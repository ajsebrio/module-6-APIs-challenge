# Description
Utilize Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook, and Application Programming Interface (API): `OpenWeatherMap` and `Geoapify` to analyze the weather as we approach the equator. 

# Instructions
- See `WeatherPy` jupyter notebook and python file for analysis of max temperatures, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed based on the latitude of the cities in the Northern and Southern Hemisphere.
- See  `VacationPy` jupyter notebook and python file for map visualizations of the cities based on their humidity and the nearest hotels in locations with favorable weather conditions.
- The `output_data` folder contains the `cities.csv` and figures of:
###### (1) Max Temp. vs. Latitude - `Fig1.png` 
###### (2) Humidty vs. Latitude - `Fig2.png` 
###### (3) Cloudiness vs. Latitude - `Fig3.png` 
###### (4) Wind Speed vs. Latitude - `Fig4.png`
